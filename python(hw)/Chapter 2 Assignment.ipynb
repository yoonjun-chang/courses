Therefore, if variables types other than string were to be entered, it needs to be converted using the functions."

It is reasonable to assume that the reader can figure out what the code does; it is much more useful to explain why.\" This means that you don't comment every single line which will make the code even more confusing than before. Rather than commenting on what the code does, it is better to explain why the code was included."
