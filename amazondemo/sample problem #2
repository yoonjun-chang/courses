#sample Amazon demo assessment problem #2

#The greatest common divisor (GCD), also called highest common factor (HCF) of N numbers is the largest positive integer
#that divides all numbers without giving a remainder.
#Write an algorithm to determine the GCD of N positive integers

#input:
#Two arguments
#-num, an integer representing the number of positive integers (N)
#-arr, a list of positive integers
